# drewtato.github.io, AKA andrewirino.com

This is my personal site. I'm creating it as I learn more about HTML/CSS/JS/the madness that is the Domain Name System.

The homepage is meant to show design over engineering and has been built with readability and simplicity in mind. The only outside resource it uses is Google Fonts.

The portfolio page is meant to showcase some of my photography and is a bit more practical. It uses jQuery and includes CSS3 Flexbox.
